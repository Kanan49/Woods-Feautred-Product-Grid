The clamp() function takes three arguments:
    Minimum value:
    The smallest font size allowed. The font will not go below this value, regardless of the preferred value or viewport size.
    Preferred value:
    The ideal font size, typically expressed in a responsive unit like vw (viewport width) or a calculation involving vw. This value dictates how the font scales with the viewport.
    Maximum value:
    The largest font size allowed. The font will not exceed this value, even if the preferred value or viewport size would otherwise make it larger.
